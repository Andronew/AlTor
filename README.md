# AlTor
An automatic torrenting bot that checks a gmail account, assigned through the code of the project, for emails from whitelisted accounts, and searchs/downloads the top seeded torrent of the email's body's string on kat.cr. This is very, very rough, unoptimized, but working, code. The project will be updated with cleaner code in the future.

#Changes Needed To Be Made By You
Note lines 9, 10, 18, 19, 468, 505, 523, and 528 in Form1.vb. These lines have comments of what needs to be inputted by you such as your bot's email and whitelist. Also, the bot uses the browser Google Chrome to download the torrents. 

#Notice
This bot is not intended to be used for illegal purposes but rather for easier acquirement of legally distributed torrents to begin downloading while you're away from the computer running this bot.
