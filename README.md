# AlTor
An automatic torrenting bot that checks a gmail account, assigned through the code of the project, for emails from whitelisted accounts, and searchs/downloads the top seeded torrent of the email's body's string on kat.cr. This is very, very rough, unoptimized, but working, code. The project will be updated with cleaner code in the future.

# Configuration
Note lines 515, 526, 542 in Form1.vb. These lines have comments of how to format the config files with the email address (needs to be gmail), password, and whitelist. Also, the bot uses the browser Google Chrome to download the torrents. If you run my AutoTorrentMonitor (https://github.com/Andronew/AutoTorrentMonitor) alongside the bot, and have the download directory of Chrome set to the running location of the monitor, the torrents will be automatically opened once downloaded and begin downloading in your torrent program.

# Notice
This bot is not intended to be used for illegal purposes but rather for easier acquirement of legally distributed torrents to begin downloading while you're away from the computer running this bot.
