# AlTor
A automatic torrenting bot that checks a gmail account, assigned through the code of the project, for emails from whitelisted accounts, and searchs/downloads the top seeded torrent of the email's body's string. This is very, very rough, unoptimized, but working, code. The project will be updated with cleaner code in the future.
